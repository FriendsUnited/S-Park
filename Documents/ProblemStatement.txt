Develop an IoT enabled solution with Android application to give real-time parking space available on the Campus / City / Resident Societies


The above mentioned will be applicable to those vehicles that have already registered in to the system and used the navigating system. 
But we also need to consider those vehicles which have not registered and are manually finding parking space and heading towards the same parking slot. 
Can you solve this problem? Develop a smart efficient application system to solve the problem related to real-time parking space.
Whenever a person wants to find a parking space on the campus, he has already registered to the application using his user id and password.
When he finds for the parking space, the server will send a response with the available parking details, real-time mapped directions and real-time parking space to allocate parking according to the size of the vehicle. 
The application would be smart enough to identify whether the car is heading towards the same parking space or 
If not, the application would re-route the same car to another nearest available parking space.
